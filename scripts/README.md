# 401k vs Roth 401K Analysis: High-Income Earner Study

## Summary

Comprehensive 60-year lifecycle analysis comparing 401k vs Roth 401K strategies for a high-income earner ($550k/year). The analysis calculates actual retirement tax rates based on withdrawal amounts rather than making assumptions, and compares strategies based on after-tax lifestyle standards.

## Key Methodology

- **Dynamic Tax Calculation**: Calculate retirement tax rates based on actual withdrawal amounts rather than assumptions
- **Equal Lifestyle Comparison**: Compare strategies based on equal after-tax standard of living
- **Complete Lifecycle**: 60-year analysis from investment (ages 35-65) to retirement (ages 65-95)
- **Mixed Account Structure**: 401k creates both pre-tax and taxable accounts

## Assumptions

- **Income**: $550,000/year
- **Investment Returns**: 7% accumulation, 5% retirement
- **Tax Rates**: Calculated, not assumed
- **Tax Rates are complex**: Calculated tax rates account for brackets. E.g. the first $12k is taxed at 10%, the next segment at 12%, etc.
- **Tax savings from 401K are invested**: 401K pre-tax savings will be invested at the same investment return rates
- **401K extra savings are taxed**: 401k pre-tax savings that are invested are also taxed
- **Contribution Limits**: Maximizes contribution limits, including catch ups when 50+
- **Goal**: Both strategies deplete to $0 at age 95
